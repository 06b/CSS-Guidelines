## Introduction

CSS is not a pretty language: for all it is simple to learn and get started
with, it soon becomes problematic at any reasonable scale. There isn’t much we
can do to change how CSS works, but we can make changes to the way we author and
structure it.

In working on large, long-running projects, with dozens of developers of
different specialisms and abilities, it is important that we all work in a
unified way in order to—among other things—

* keep stylesheets maintainable.
* keep code transparent, sane, and readable.
* keep stylesheets scalable.

There are a variety of techniques we must employ in order to satisfy these
goals, and <cite>CSS Guidelines</cite> is a document of recommendations and
approaches that will help us to do so.

### Importance of a Styleguide

A coding styleguide—note, not a visual styleguide—is a valuable tool for teams
who

* build and maintain products for a reasonable length of time.
* have developers of differing abilities and specialisms.
* have a number of different developers working on a product at any given time.
* on-board new staff regularly.
* have a number of codebases that developers dip in and out of.

Whilst styleguides are typically more suited to product teams—large codebases on
long-lived and evolving projects, with multiple developers contributing over
prolonged periods of time—all developers should strive for a degree of
standardisation in their code.

A good styleguide, when well followed, will

* set the standard for code quality across a codebase.
* promote consistency across codebases.
* give developers a feeling of familiarity across codebases.
* increase productivity.

Styleguides should be learned, understood, and implemented at all times on a
project which is governed by one, and any deviation must be fully justified.

<cite>CSS Guidelines</cite> is *a* styleguide; it is not *the* styleguide. It
contains methodologies, techniques, and tips that I would firmly recommend to my
clients and teams, but your own tastes and circumstances may well be different.
Your mileage may vary.
